<p> I am from Mokena Illinois. I am a freshman here at St. Ambrose and I am majoring in Computer and Network Security. I haven't really coded until senior year of highschool. In highschool I took AP computer science which was a very confusing  class and I don't really remember much from it. So if anyone has tips and tricks to coding please let me know!  </p>
